//! ## fljúga handahófi MLIR abstract GPU dialect support.
//!
//! Describes abstract GPU handling dialect.
//!
//! **NOTE:** This is fairly undercooked, and may be used primarily with NVVM/NVGPU stuff
//! *fljúga handahófi* will backport all the relevant GPU transformations, whenever possible,
//! so this should be safe to skip in the nearest future.
